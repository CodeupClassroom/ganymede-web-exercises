                Must go faster. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. Must go faster. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! What do they got in there? King Kong? You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

King Kong? You really think you can fly that thing? You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Checkmate... Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Must go faster.
